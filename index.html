    <h1>Assignment 2a</h1>
    <p>In many functional programming languages such as Haskell the idea of
    <strong>Higher Order Functions</strong> is built right into the core of the
    language.</p>

    <p>Higher Order Functions (aka First-Class Functions) is the idea that
    functions can be used as a form of data. They can be used as arguments,
    stored in variables, and ever returned from other functions! Note that some
    meta paradigm languages like Lisp further extend this concept by expressing
    functions and other programming structures as lists. This allows the
    programmer to prepend and append functions to other functions!</p>
